## Food 52 Parser
### Step Parsing
Steps are identified using the "recipe__list--steps" tag. This list contains two type of elements one being actual steps to execute and the other being subheadings grouping the instructions into several parts (recipe__list-subheading).

Some recipes have various parts (eg. making homemade pasta bolognese, there might be one part to make the pasta and on for the sauce). The different parts identified using:
````
steps_object.find_all('ol')
````
For each part the parts datastructure is populated and returned as a list of parts. 
````
 [ {"steps" : [STEP1, STEP2, ...], "method_name" : <method_name> }, ... ]
 ````

In the abstract parser / non_linear_parsing_utils, these field are then treated as follows. The speech_text of the output interaction is populated with the actual step. The screen_text is populated with the concatenation of the text headling and the actual step, split by newlines. If there is no headline, the screen_text is just the actual step text.
```
output_interaction.speech_text = step.text
screen_text = f"{step.headline}<br><br>{step.text}"
```

## Wikihow Parsing
### Requirements
The requirement parsing is parsing both requirements lists of wikihow, the 'Things Youâ€™ll Need' list and the 'Ingredients' list.
Lists are identified by their ids. The lists are scraped, combined and then returned.

NOTE that the method_name has to start with Part to be handled properly by the `non_linear_parsing_utils`.

In case there is only one part the behaviour has not changed.

### Filter out non-English articles
New function `get_validity` pattern matches `https://www.wikihow.com`, because non-English entries all contain a country identififer after `www` like `'https://www.de.wikihow.com`. If there is a country code, `False` will be returned which will cause the taskgraph to be removed in the `abstract_parser`.
