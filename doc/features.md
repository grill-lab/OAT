# GRILLBot Features

## Preference Elicitation
If you are not too sure what to do, we aim to help by recommending options based on your preferences. 
GRILLBot can help you decide what to do. 
Tell GRILLBot if you want home improvement or Cooking, and see how GRILLBot can guide you to a recommendation.

Examples:
<ul>
  <li><i>I want to cook</i></li>
  <li><i>home improvement</i></li>
</ul>

## Task Search
Let GRILLBot assist you with a task of your choice. 
Currently, we support the domains of Cooking and DIY. 
We have given you a slimmed-down version of our task dataset, containing 10,000 tasks from our web sources, as the complete data set would have been too big to download. 
So try out task search by asking what you would like to cook or improve in your home.

Examples:
<ul>
  <li><i>Help me make a Caesar salad</i></li>
  <li><i>I want to paint a wall</i></li>
</ul>

## Task Execution
After you have selected a task, you can walk through it by interacting with GRILLBot at each step. 
You can navigate through the task using natural language.

Examples:
<ul>
  <li><i>Next</i></li>
  <li><i>I've finished the step</i></li>
  <li><i>Go to step 6</i></li>
  <li><i>Go back please</i></li>
</ul>

## Task QA
During the execution of the task, you can ask questions about the content mentioned in the steps. 
You can also ask questions about the requirements and ask for more details.

Examples:
<ul>
  <li><i>What ingedients did I need?</i></li>
  <li><i>How many cups of flour?</i></li>
  <li><i>What tempertaure should I set the oven?</i></li>
</ul>
