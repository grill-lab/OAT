# OAT Google Cloud deployment parameters
# 
# This file is parsed by oat_gcp.sh to obtain default
# values for all the parameters. You can override any of
# them by running the script with the appropriate environment
# variable set, e.g.
#    > VM_NAME=foobar ./oat_gcp.sh create
# to override the value of vm_name below.

# compute region for the deployment, e.g. europe-west2. Different zones may have different
# costs associated with them!

# compute zone for the deployment (this should be a zone within the above region, e.g. europe-west2-a)
zone="${ZONE:-europe-west2-a}"
# the names of the services that are required for the deployment:
# - Compute Engine API
declare -a required_services=( compute.googleapis.com )
# machine-type value for the GCP VM.
# These are described at https://cloud.google.com/compute/docs/machine-types
# Default is e2-standard-4 (4 cores, 16GB)

# OS image for the VM. Defaults to Ubuntu 22.04

# Boot disk size (in gigabytes) for the cluster nodes. 
# Increasing this will increase costs! 50GB is enough, but gcloud warns that a disk
# under 200GB might be slower so use that as the default for now

# the name for the VM to create/use
vm_name="${VM_NAME:-oat-vm-1}"
# the script will make a temporary clone of the repo on your local machine and copy this
# to the VM instance. Set this to the name of the branch that you want to checkout and 
# run in the VM.
