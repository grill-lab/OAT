#    > VM_NAME=foobar ./oat_gcp.sh create

# enable or disable GPU support in the GCP VM. OAT can run without a GPU by limiting
# some functionality, but if you want to run the full system you can enable GPU support
# here. It defaults to being disabled because a GPU-enabled VM instance will have a 
# significantly higher hourly cost than a standard instance. 
#
# To enable GPU support, set the value of this variable to "true".
# *** This will cost significantly more per-hour than a non-GPU E2 instance! ***
