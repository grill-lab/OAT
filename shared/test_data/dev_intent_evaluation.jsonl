Use scissors to trim away any excess paper that extends beyond the length of the lead.\nWhen measuring out the length of your pencil, make sure that one end of the lead is flat against one edge of the paper. Measure out the length using the other end.\nOrigami paper works best, since it's pretty and easy to manipulate. Newspaper or other waste paper is harder to wrap round the pencil, but friendlier to the environment.\nIn terms of hardness, make sure that your pencil lead is HB.
